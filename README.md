## Use Case / How It Works

> If you want to convert __X__ to __Y__, or automate __Z__, this tool does it for you.

For example:
```txt
Input: 3.50 mol of sucrose  
→ Output: 2.107x10^24 molecules  
→ Explained: Step-by-step breakdown with Avogadro’s constant
```

- It does exactly that, converts it from one thing to another, and it supports many conversions

---

## Future Plans

- [ ] Add more converisons + support for other things
- [ ] More intuitive UI  
- [ ] Dark mode + Super dark mode  
- [ ] Integration with AI and Educators
